# Advent of Code
---
This is my version of all the solutions for this years [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)

Its all written in c++ as i'm currently training myself for a new position.

Rules
---

- The code is self relient
- Written by me (with few exceptions)
- Be simple enough to be contained in one file


# Compiling
---

The provided makefile should allow you to compile all the days code in the following way
```
$ cd day1
$ make day1
$ ./day1 day1test
$ ./day1 day1input
```
